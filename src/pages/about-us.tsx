        The Overland BlazerBots seek to provide a diverse, inclusive and fun
        learning environment for all of its members through competitive
        robotics. Students learn business, design, fabrication, programming and
        most importantly, collaboration. We plan to develop a competitive and
        spirited team to educate and inspire students far into the future.
        <br />
        <strong>
          Our mission is to leave a legacy with every step we take and every
          robot we make.

          in Aurora, Colorado. The team launched in 2011 and competes annually in FIRST
          Robotics Competition (FRC), an international competition that
          challenges students to create a competitive 115 pound robot in
          approximately 10 weeks every spring. Over the course of a season, our
          students learn critical STEM skills, collaboration, leadership, and
          most importantly, have the hardest fun they'll ever have!
          <br />
          Every January, FIRST release a new game, played by teams around the world.
          Games vary widely and have included tasks from shooting
          foam basketballs to stacking totes and from launching foam rings to to placing PVC pipes on a structure.
          <br />
          Students are challenged to strategize, design, build, and program a robot to play the game, all in about 10 weeks.
          The must collaborate and closely communicate with each other to ensure that the robot is ready for competition in time.
