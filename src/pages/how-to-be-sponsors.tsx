      <p>
        We're always seeking funding and sponsors to support our budget, which was grown to nearly $20,000 per year.
        We offer four tiers of sponsorship: {makeSponsorTierText("Bronze")}, {makeSponsorTierText("Silver")}, {makeSponsorTierText("Gold")}, and {makeSponsorTierText("Pink")}. Each offers logo placement with increasing visibility, starting with our website for Bronze and culminating in a large logo on our competition robot.
        See our sponsorship packet below for details!
      </p>
      <p>Contact Sam Goldman at <a href="mailto:sgoldman@cherrycreekschools.org?subject=BlazerBots Sponsorship Inquiry">sgoldman@cherrycreekschools.org</a> with any questions or to get started.</p>

      <p>We look forward to working with you and to seeing your logo on our robot!</p>
